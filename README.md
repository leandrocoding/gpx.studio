[**gpx.studio**](https://gpx.studio) is an online tool for creating and editing GPX files. 

![gpx.studio screenshot](website/src/lib/assets/img/docs/getting-started/interface.png)

This repository contains the source code of the website.

## Contributing 

Please create an issue if you find a bug or have a feature request.

Code contributions are also welcome, but except for obvious bug fixes, please open an issue first to discuss the changes you would like to make.

## Translation

The website is translated by volunteers on a collaborative translation platform.
You can help complete and improve the translations by joining the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/gpxstudio).
If you would like to start the translation in a new language, please contact me or create an issue.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

## Development

The code is split into two parts:
- `gpx`: a Typescript library for parsing and manipulating GPX files,
- `website`: the website itself, which is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) application.

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to build and run these two parts.

### Building the `gpx` library

```bash
cd gpx
npm install
npm run build
```

### Running the website

To be able to load the map, you will need to create your own <a href="https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup" target="_blank">Mapbox access token</a> and store it in a `.env` file in the `website` directory.

```bash
cd website
echo PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN={YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN} >> .env
npm install
npm run dev
```
